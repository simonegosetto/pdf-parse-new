Acute effect of speed exercise on nitric oxide (NO)
level of footballers
Aim: Exercise is one of the low-cost and easiest ways for improving life standards and physical
fitness, and reducing body stress. Nitric oxide (NO) is defined as the “surprising soldier mediator”
of biological systems. NO is one of the relaxation factors coming from the vascular endothelium.
This relaxation in smooth muscles leads to vasodilatation in veins. The purpose of this study is to
evaluate the acute effect of 20-meter sprints of footballers on NO levels.
Materials and Methods: 22 footballers with an age range of 18–32 were voluntarily enrolled in the
study. The heights and weights of the subjects were measured. Speed measures were taken with a
photocell system. The 20-meter sprint was repeated for 10 times. Blood samples were taken before
and immediately after the sprint. For statistical analysis paired t test was used.
Results: The mean age, height, and weight of the footballers included in the study were 24.21 ±
3.41 years, 173 ± 7.04 cm, and 67.85 ± 5.17 kg, respectively. The mean NO values were 21.45 ± 2.08
immediately after the exercise and 25.59 ± 1.59 before the exercise (mean ± SD). This decrease in
the NO level after the exercise, compared to before, were not statistically meaningful (P = 0.052).
Conclusions: The fact that the exercise was short-term yet with maximal load and negative
developments occurred within the body may have highlighted the oxidative damage. The NO
defence used against this damage may have decreased the values.
Key Words: Nitric oxide, speed exercise, footballer
Futbolcularda sürat egzersizinin nitrik oksit (NO)
düzeyi üzerine akut etkisi
Amaç: Egzersiz, insanları stresten uzaklaştıran, hayat standartlarını yükselten ve fiziksel
uygunluğu iyi duruma getirmek için kullanılan en ucuz ve kolay yoldur. Nitrik oksit (NO)
biyolojik sistemlerin “şaşırtıcı asker aracısı” olarak tanımlanır. NO vasküler endotelyumdan çıkan
dinlenme faktörüdür. Bu düz kaslardaki relaks damarlarla vasodilatasyona neden olur. Bu
çalışmanın amacı; futbolcularda 20 metrelik sürat koşularının NO düzeylerine akut etkisini
araştırmaktır.
Gereç ve Yöntem: Araştırmaya yaşları 18-32 yaş arasında değişen 22 futbolcu gönüllü olarak
katıldı. Deneklerin boy ve beden ağırlık ölçümleri alındı. Sürat ölçümleri fotosel ile yapıldı. 20
metrelik sürat koşusu 10 kez tekrar ettirildi. Sürat egzersizi öncesi ve hemen sonrası kan örnekleri
alındı. İstatistiksel analiz için paired t testi kullanıldı.
Bulgular: Çalışmaya dahil edilen futbolcuların yaşları 24,21 ± 3,41 yıl, boyları 173 ± 7,04 cm. ve
beden ağırlığı 67,85 ± 5,17 kg. olarak belirlendi. Sürat egzersizi öncesi NO değerleri 25,59 ±
1,59’ iken, egzersiz hemen sonrası 21,45 ± 2,08 olarak bulundu (A.O ± SS). Egzersizden hemen
sonrasındaki NO düzeyindeki bu düşüş istatistiksel olarak anlamlı değildi (P = 0,052).
Sonuç: Egzersizin kısa süreli ancak maksimal yüklenmeli olması, vücutta meydana gelen negatif
gelişmeler oksidatif hasarı öne çıkarmış olabilir. Bu hasara karşı kullanılan NO savunması,
değerleri aşağıya düşürmüş olabilir.

Introduction
Until 15-20 years ago, NO was thought to be
merely the exhaust gas of automobiles, an
atmospheric gas found in cigarettes, and an agent
polluting the atmosphere. It has been articulated in
previous studies that NO, which has been qualified
as a harmful molecule since it is a free radical due to
the unpaired electron it bore, is actually an
important molecule that balances the blood pressure
and vasodilatation (1,2).
NO causes vasodilatation in veins and accelerates
blood flow. NO, which regulates the blood
circulation, also keeps the veins clean. The vein
network rich in NO is slippery like Teflon and allows
for the flow of plaques preventing the enlargement
of clots, whereas the unhealthy vein, or the vein poor
in NO, leads to collection of plaques in the adhesive
inner surface of the vein (3,4).
NO radical prevents the excessive accumulation
of free radicals in tissues by reacting with other free
radicals (5,6). Whereas other free oxygen radicals
are harmful in every concentration, NO plays a role
in regulating a range of physiological events, such as
digestion system, host defence and non-specific
immunity. However, when generated
inappropriately and excessively, it causes a lot of
pathological conditions (7).
Sport generally has significant features like speed,
strength, endurance, and flexibility. Speed is the
ability to carry oneself from one point to another in
the shortest time possible (8).
In sports trainings, the organism is exposed to
loads which are over daily life levels. In exercise, it is
blood that provides the metabolic and O
2 
needs of
the tissues. Blood pressure is the force that enables
the blood flow. Blood pressure is the pressure that
exerts the blood on the vein walls (9).
The benefits of exercising have been proven
plenty of times. However, negative changes can also
be expected in connection with the short-term and
extreme changes that exercise may cause in the
human body. However, exercise, if performed
regularly and efficiently, helps strengthen the
cardiovascular, hormonal, and immune system, and
increase the muscle mass.
This study was conducted to analyze the acute
effect of speed exercise on NO levels of footballers.
Materials and Methods
Selection of the Subjects
Twenty-two active, healthy footballers, with an
age range of 18-32, free of obvious health problems
and medications were enrolled into this study. In the
study, the necessary explanations were provided to
the subjects and their consents were obtained.
Method of the Study
The subjects carried out the test after a 20-min
warm-up, 15 min of which was dedicated to general
and 5 min to specific warm-up. The test comprised
10 sprints of 20 m. The subjects started the sprint
without a start order, but when they felt ready and
completed it in maximum speed. Blood measures
were taken twice, before and immediately after the
sprint.
Instruments
Height and Weight Measure
The heights of the subjects were measured
without shoes, with a stadiometer (Holtain, UK) in
cm; and they were weighed in shorts with an
electronic scale (Seca, Germany) in kg.
Speed Measure
The speed was measured in a gym on a smooth
and synthetic floor. The time between the start and
finish points were measured with a 0.01 s sensitive
photocell system (New Test 2000, Finland). Cones
were used in order to specify the sprint field.
Blood Measures
Blood samples were drown from antecubital vein
using the heparinised tubes. The samples were taken
before and immediately after the loading. The
elements were precipitated by centrifuge for 5 min at
3500 rpm; the plasma part at the top was taken into
Eppendorf tubes and kept at -80 °C until analysis.
Nitrite determination
Nitrite was measured using the Griess reaction
(10). Briefly, plasma samples were diluted 4-fold
with distilled water and deproteinized by adding
l/20th volume of zinc sulfate (300 g/l) to give a final

concentration of 15 g/l. After centrifugation at
10,000×g for 5 min at room temperature (or 1000×g
for 15 min), 100 μl of supernate was applied to a
microtiter plate well, followed by 100/μl of Griess
reagent (1 g/l sulfanilamide, 25 g/l phosphoric acid,
and 0.1 g/l N-1-naphthylethylenediamine). After 10
min of colour development at room temperature,
the absorbance was measured on a microplate
reader (Tiertek Multiskan MCC/340; Flow Lab,
McLean, VA) at a wavelength of 540 nm. Each
sample was assayed in duplicate wells. Background
values were obtained by treating samples as
described but by using 25 g/l phosphoric acid
instead of complete Griesa reagent. Calibration
curves were genereated with sodium nitrite and
potassium nitrate in distilled water (linear range 0-
100 μmol/l). The detection limit of the assay is ~1.5
μmol/l in distilled water. There was no difference
between the spectrum of authentic nitrite in distilled
water and the spectra of negative plasma samples
supplemented with exogenous nitrite or the spectra
of positive plasma samples. In all these specimens,
maximal absorbance occurred at 540 nm (data not
shown). The molar absorptivity of the coloured
product was 39,500 l mol
-1 
cm
-1
Nitrate determination
Nitrate was measured as nitrite after enzymatic
conversion by nitrate reductase (EC 1.6.6.2) as
described by Schmidt et al. (11). Briefly, 100 μl of
plasma was diluted 4-fold with distilled water.
NADPH, FAD, and nitrate reductase from
Aspergillus spp. (Boehringer Mannheim,
Mannheim, Germany) were added to yield final
concentrations of 50 μmol/, 5 μmol/l, and 200 U/l,
respectively.
Samples were further incubated for 5 min at 37
°C to oxidize NADPH [which interferes with the
assay] (11), deproteinized, and assayed with Griess
reagent as described above. Values obtained by this
procedure represent the sum of nitrite and nitrate.
Nitrate concentrations were obtained by subtracting
nitrite concentrations from the total nitrate + nitrite
concentrations.
Statistical Analysis
SPSS 16.0 statistics program was used in
analysing the data obtained. The arithmetic mean
and standard deviation of all the variants of the
footballers included in the study were calculated.
Paired samples t-test was used to compare the NO
values taken before and immediately after the speed
exercise. The difference was assumed significant if
the p value was below 0.05.
Results
The demographic results of the group were
summarized in Tables 1 and 2. NO values were
found to be 21.45 ± 2.08 immediately after the
exercise whereas they were 25.59 ± 1.59 before the
exercise. This decrease immediately after the
exercise, in comparison with before, was not a
statistically significant (P = 0.052, Figure 1).

Discussion
Recent studies show that exercise has different
effects on NO level. Presumed reasons for those
differences are the type, duration, and degree of
exercise. Particularly acute and heavy exercises can
trigger oxidative damage (12). The proportions of
oxidants and antioxidants to emerge during the
exercise vary according to the degree of exercise.
While damaging oxidant system is more activated
during heavy and rigorous exercises, regular and
short-term sport activities that are not maximal
activate the antioxidant systems better (13).
There are various basic sources of oxidant
products, such as NO products, oxygen radicals
formed through purine metabolism, and
prostaglandin. NO products, like peroxinitrites, can
contribute to oxidative damage (14). NO, thus, can
contribute to cell damage in many cells.
Xia and colleagues studied the effect of different
degrees of exercise on NO level and they showed
that there was no significant change in NO in low
and mild level exercises, whereas there was an
increase in NO concentration in high level exercises
(15). In contrast to that study, we noted that there
was a 5 U/ml decrease in NO levels after the exercise
in comparison with those before the exercise. This
can be attributed to a set of factors. One of them is
the contribution of NO to antioxidant defence in the
fight with free radicals occurring in acute exercises
of maximal level (16).
Yamamato et al. state that there is no meaningful
difference between the plasma and serum NO levels
before and immediately after exercise for aerobic
type physical exercise (17).
In another study, Keçetepen and Dursun found a
decrease in NO values immediately after exercise in
a study where sportsmen, who do sports regularly,
perform exercise for 2 min consecutively at 30, 40,
50 km/h against 100 W power, and then at
maximum speed, using a bicycle ergometer (18).
Radak et al. also state that muscular damage can
occur in connection with the increase in NO 
X
production in skeletal muscles during eccentric
contraction (19). Cuzzolin et al. state in the study
they carried out on 6 active and 6 sedentary subjects
that acute exercise can lead to NO
X 
formation (20).
In another study, a decrease was observed in
nitric oxide synthesis inhibition and active blood
flow after the dynamic knee-extensor exercise. In the
same study, NO inhibition was greater in heavy
exercise when compared with low level exercise (21).
Another study concludes that NO is not essential
for the good performance of skeleton muscles in
healthy humans (22).
Jungestern et al. compared long-distance runners
and students who do not exercise regularly and
came up with a meaningful difference in NO levels
of long distance runners after exercise in
comparison with those before exercise.
Furthermore, there was a meaningful increase in
NO levels of students who do not exercise regularly
after exercise in comparison with before (23).
In our study, the NO levels may have been found
to be low for that moment since the blood samples
were taken immediately after maximal loading. As a
result of the increase in radicals during heavy
exercise, it is possible for some of the NO to be
directed to radicals. However, different results could
have been obtained if blood samples had been taken
at regular intervals after exercise.
The fact that the exercise was short-term yet with
maximal load and the negative developments that
occurred within the body may have highlighted the
oxidative damage. The NO defence used against this
damage may have decreased the values.
