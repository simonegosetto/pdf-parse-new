A GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure with AlGaAs tunnel junction was grown on p-type (1 0 0)-oriented
GaAs substrate by a solid-source molecular beam epitaxy technique. The structural and morphological
properties of the GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure have been evaluated by means of secondary ion mass
spectrometry and atomic force microscopy measurements. In addition, the GaInP/GaAs solar cell device
was fabricated to obtain electrical output parameters of the cells. For this purpose, the current–voltage
measurements of solar cell devices were carried out at room temperature under both dark and air mass
1.5 global radiation (AM1.5) using solar simulator. In addition, the electrical output parameters of the
GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure with the AlGaAs tunnel junction are compared with the GaInP/GaAs solar
cell structure without the AlGaAs tunnel junction, and it is found that the integration of the tunnel
junction into a solar cell structure improves the device performance by 48%.

1. Introduction
According to literature, solar cells (SCs) can be divided into four
groups: (1) silicon-based SCs such as mono-crystalline silicon, and
poly-crystalline silicon SCs [1–7], (2) thin film SCs such as
amorphous silicon, cadmium–telluride, and copper–indium–gal-
lium–de selenide SCs [8–15], and (3) III–V group SCs such as
quantum well, and multi-junction SCs [16–29], (4) other SCs such
as organic, dye sensitized and perovskite SCs [30–33]. There has
been an increasing interest on the research and development of
multi-junction III–V group SCs due to a higher efficiency compared
to other groups SCs. Currently, the studies on these SCs are mainly
focused on the performance evaluation [34–38]. Multi-junction
SCs are sensitive to radiation of different wavelengths. A top cell is
responsive to shorter wavelengths, whereas a bottom cell is
responsive to longer wavelengths. In configuration, wider bandgap
materials are used for the top cells since they absorb short
wavelengths. Thus, it allows the longer wavelength radiation to
penetrate deeper into the device where it can be converted into
electrical energy. The commonly used highest-performing multi-
junction cells use III–V compound semiconductors with direct
bandgaps [39]. III–V Group ternary alloy materials, such as AlGaAs,
InGaAs, InGaN and GaInP, were widely used as the top cell of SCs
[18,20,22,25,27,29,34–38]. Among these materials, GaInP ternary
alloy is an essential material for high efficiency SCs as it absorbs
the visible part of the solar spectrum [40]. In addition, GaAs binary
compound (bandgap: 1.42 eV) absorbs near-infrared part of the
solar spectrum. When the Ga composition ratio is approximately
51% of the GaInP/GaAs structure, GaInP ternary alloy grows on a
GaAs substrate with lattice-match, and this structure has great
technological importance [40–42]. The GaInP/GaAs SC structure
will continue to be the focus of attention in the photovoltaic works
as it absorbs the large part of the solar spectrum.
Tunnel junctions (TJs) are highly doped p–n diodes which allow
for quantum mechanical tunneling through their narrow depletion
regions. TJs are very crucial for multi-junction SCs, and they have
properties such as a relatively optically transparent and low
resistance [43]. According to the tunneling effect, the electron
does not need extra energy for tunneling from the bottom of the
conduction band to the top of the valence band. In addition,
heavily doped AlGas, InGaP, GaAs, etc. are selected as TJs in III–V
group SCs [27]. Several researches have studied the SCs structure
with an integration of TJ [27,28,34]. Siyu et al. [27] examined the
characteristics of the TJ, the material used in the TJ, the compen-
sation of the TJ to the overall cell’s characteristics, the TJs’
influence on the current density of sub-cells and the efficiency
increase. Wheelden et al. [28] investigated four different TJ designs

(AlGaAs/AlGaAs, GaAs/GaAs, AlGaAs/InGaP, AlGaAs/GaAs) for
multi-junction SCs under high concentration to determine the
peak tunneling current and resistance change as a function of the
doping concentration. They clearly demonstrated that the advan-
tages of the AlGaAs/GaAs and the AlGaAs/AlGaAs TJ design more
than the GaAs/GaAs and the AlGaAs/InGaP TJ design. Samberg
et al. [34] investigated the effect of the heterojunction interface on
the performance of high bandgap InGaP:Te/AlGaAs:C TJs and the
compared experimental results with the modeling results are
reasonable. They showed that the high tunneling current achieved
in these TJs with a voltage drop of only a few mV across the
junction can allow multi-junction SCs to operate at higher con-
centrations. As a result, TJ plays a crucial role in the multi-junction
cell design, and they have an essential impact on the performance
and reliability of the devices.
In our previous study [37], the GaInP/GaAs SC structure was
grown using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. We
investigated the structural, optical and morphological properties
of GaInP/GaAs solar cell (SC) structure, and we also obtained the
energy conversion efficiency value as 9.13%. In the light of our
previous study, the purpose of this research is to examine the
effect of AlGaAs TJ on the cell’s electrical output parameters of the
GaInP/GaAs SC structure. Thus, this paper is organized as follows:
the GaInP/GaAs SC structure was grown on p-type (1 0 0)-oriented
GaAs substrate by MBE. The secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) measurement was preferred to analyze the depth profile of
the GaInP/GaAs SC structure. Thus, not only main elements (Ga, In,
Al, As and P) were detected, but also dopant elements (Si and Be)
in the epi-layer. The morphology and the surface roughness were
determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements.
In addition, device parameters such as open-circuit voltage (V
oc 
),
short-circuit current (I
sc
), fill factor (FF) and energy conversion
efficiency (
η) of GaInP/GaAs SC structure with AlGaAs TJ were
extracted from the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics.
2. Experimental method
The GaInP/GaAs SC structure was grown on a p-type (1 0 0)-
oriented GaAs substrate using a V80H solid source MBE system.
Prior to the growth process, the GaAs substrate was chemically
cleaned. After the cleaning process, first a 1.2 mm thick p-GaAs
layer was grown on the substrate at about substrate temperature
of T 
s 
¼650 1C and then 150 nm thick n-GaAs (bottom cell) was
grown at T 
s 
¼640 1C. After then 50 nm thick nþ þAlGaAs and
50 nm thick pþ þAlGaAs were grown at the same temperature
from the AlGaAs tunnel junction. Then 320 nm thick p-GaInP and
80 nm thick n-GaInP (top cell) were grown using a GaP decom-
position source at T
s 
¼530 1C, respectively. The solar cell structure
was completed by a growth of a 50 nm thick n-AlGaAs window
layer and a 60 nm thick n-GaAs layer. Si and Be were incorporated
as an n-type and p-type dopant, respectively. The schematic
diagram of the solar cell structure is represented in Fig. 1. The
reconstruction of the epi-surfaces and growth rate were deter-
mined using reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
oscillations.
Atomic distributions and interface characteristics of the GaInP/
GaAs SC structure were performed by SIMS (Hiden Analytical Ltd.,
Warrington, UK) depth profile measurements. The SIMS measure-
ments were carried out with an O
2 
(oxygen) gun set at an ion
energy of 5 keV and with a detector sensitivity of 400 nA/V. During
the SIMS experiments, base pressure of the chamber was kept at
10
 10 
mbar.

Morphological properties of the GaInP/GaAs SC structure were
characterized at room temperature (RT) using high performance
AFM (Nano Magnetics Instruments Ltd., Oxford, UK) using
dynamic mode scanning. The scan area was set as 5  5 
μm 
2 
,
and the scan rate was 2 Hz (using a resolution of 256 lines
per scan).
For the electrical characterization of the GaInP/GaAs SC struc-
ture, first the back contact was formed. For the back metal pad
pattering, photolithograpy process was done using square
(0.64 cm 
2 
) mask and the schematic diagram is represented in
Fig. 2a. The metallization was then completed by deposition of
high purity Au (99.999%) using thermal evaporation system with
10
 8 
mbar base pressure. For the front metal pad pattering,
photolithograpy process was done using mask, and the schematic
diagram is represented in Fig. 2b, and the metalization was
completed by deposition of high purity Au (99.999%). As a last
step of the fabrication process, the GaInP/GaAs SC was annealed
via rapid thermal annealing during 60 s at 400 1C to form ohmic
metallization. The photolithography process was performed using
Kalr-Suss MJB4 mask aligner system, and the current–voltage
characteristics were performed using Keithley 4200 source-
meter and Oriel Sol1A class AAA solar simulator.
3. Results and discussion
In this work, we have investigated the performance evaluation
of the GaInP/GaAs solar cell structure with the integration of
AlGaAs tunnel junction. The performance of the solar cell struc-
tures significantly depends on the atomic homogenity in the
grown layers and interface characteristics. Thus, SIMS is an
important and widely used analytical technique in semiconductor
device structures such as SCs to examine dopant profiling within a
patterned junction or contact. Therefore, SIMS analysis was per-
formed to investigate layer-by-layer growth mode of the GaInP/
GaAs SC structure. Although the reference sample was not used to
calculate concentrations of the dopant elements (Si and Be), their
dispersions in the layers were successfully determined from the
SIMS depth profile, as seen in Fig. 3. In addition, achievement of
desired 100 nm thick AlGaAs TJ between top n-GaInP and bottom
n-GaAs cells can be clearly seen from Fig. 4.
Fig. 5a and b shows that two-dimensional (2D) and three-
dimensional (3D) AFM images with a 5  5 
μm 
2 
scan area of the
GaInP/GaAs SC structure, respectively. The SC structure has a very
uniform surface morphology with root mean square (RMS) rough-
ness of 1.75 nm (given in Table 1) without any surface cracks or

defects. It is well known that RMS roughness is effective on
efficiency of the SC structure, and the device efficiency increases
with increasing the RMS value as emphasized in our previous
study [37].
After the completion of the structural and morphological cha-
racterizations, the electrical characterization was done at room
temperature, and I–V characteristic was shown in Fig. 6. The
overall solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of a solar
cell is defined as the ratio of the maximum output of the cell
divided by the power of incident light. It can be determined by the
V
oc 
, I
sc
, FF, and the intensity of the incident light (P
in
) as shown in
Eq. (1). Since it is dependent on all the three first factors under
standard conditions, it is of great importance to optimize each one
of them for high overall efficiency [44].

we compare these results with our previous study, both the
integration of the TJ into the SC structure and increasing the
RMS value improves the device performance by 48%.
4. Conclusion
In this work, we report the growth, characterizations and
fabrication of the GaInP/GaAs SC structure with the AlGaAs TJ.
Lattice-match GaInP/GaAs SC structure was successfully grown by
solid source MBE with a GaP decomposition source. The structural
characterization was done using SIMS, and it was found that
AlGaAs TJ between top n-GaInP and bottom n-GaAs cells with
the desired thickness of 100 nm was achieved. The morphological
characterization was done using AFM, and it was found defetcts on
surface, and crack-free uniform surface morphology could be
achieved. At last, the SC device was fabricated using photolitho-
graphy, and electrical characterization was performed under both
and air mass 1.5 global radiation (AM1.5G) using a solar simulator,
and it was found that the integration of AlGaAs TJ increases the
efficiency of the SC structure by 48%. According to experimental
results, the integration of TJ is very effective on device perfor-
mance, and the SC structure having AlGaAs TJ can be a promising
candidate to be used as a photovoltaic device.
